fix(app-router): properly await params object in dynamic routes

- Fix error in `/posts/[slug]` route by awaiting the entire params object
- Replace direct access to params.slug with properly awaited pattern
- Update both Post component and generateMetadata function
- Ensures compliance with Next.js App Router's handling of dynamic route parameters

The previous implementation incorrectly destructured params and then
awaited only the slug property, causing the error:
"Route '/posts/[slug]' used params.slug. params should be awaited before using its properties"
