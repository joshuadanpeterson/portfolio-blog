# From VS Code to Warp: When Terminal Evolution Becomes Advocacy

Two years ago, I made a simple editor switch that spiraled into something unexpected—a Developer Advocate role that emerged organically from genuine enthusiasm. This isn't a pitch; it's a map of that journey for anyone curious about next-generation terminals and how advocacy sometimes writes itself.

## The VS Code Wall

Boot camp introduced me to VS Code, like most developers these days. Initially, the magic was real: IntelliSense humming, Git diffs inline, extensions for everything imaginable. Then reality set in. After installing essential plugins, my "lightweight" editor opened like it was swimming through tar. File saves lagged. Context-switching between editor and terminal felt like changing gears with a broken clutch.

Here's what they don't tell you in boot camp: productivity tools that destroy productivity are just expensive procrastination.

## Terminal-First Awakening

Neovim captured me in a weekend. Modal editing, Lua configuration, instantaneous startup—everything aligned with the tight feedback loops I needed. Living in the terminal suddenly made sense, though I still juggled iTerm2 and Fig (that VS Code-style autocomplete for the command line).

The setup worked until it didn't:

- iTerm2's new AI sidebar felt grafted on, not integrated—like a midlife crisis feature nobody asked for
- Fig's Amazon acquisition and rebrand to Q Developer added bloat, lost nimbleness
- My toolchain resembled a precarious tower of competing philosophies

## Enter Warp

A YouTube deep-dive introduced me to Warp—a Rust-built terminal featuring block-based history and native autocomplete. The blocks were clever, but Fig's customization kept me loyal. Warp remained a curiosity sitting in my Applications folder.

Then Warp shipped its in-prompt AI assistant.

Not another sidebar. Not another popup. Just type natural language, hit Enter, watch it translate to shell commands—right at your cursor. No extra UI. No context switch. The difference between "neat feature" and "this changes everything."

## The Agent Revolution

### When Agents Got Real

When Warp launched Agent Mode, I assumed it was marketing speak for their existing AI. Weeks later, I discovered agents could execute CLI tools, patch files, and roll back mistakes autonomously. The repetitive glue work that once consumed hours became delegated conversations.

### Memory Changes the Game

Memory and Knowledge MCPs arrived like missing puzzle pieces. My agent understood project context and preserved it between sessions. Refactors evolved from scattered one-offs to coherent, multi-file operations guided by persistent domain knowledge. No more goldfish-brained assistants.

### Parallel Intelligence

Warp's multi-agent panels multiplied productivity exponentially. Claude 4 Opus handled substantive edits while o3 tackled architectural planning—all in parallel. Warp 2.0's Agent Management tab brought order to potential chaos: approve diffs, tweak prompts, cancel runaway processes with single clicks.

## From Power User to Developer Advocate

By this point, I was evangelizing Warp to my followers every few days. Three weeks ago, Warp formalized what I was already doing—I joined their Developer Advocate program.

The deal:

- Build real projects, share discoveries
- Channel bugs and feature requests upstream
- Write unfiltered posts like this one
- Participate in dev discussions across social media

What it doesn't mean:

- Sales quotas or scripted demos
- Editorial control (they don't review these words)
- Hidden agendas

I accepted because I was already doing the work. The title just opened a Slack channel with equally obsessed power users.

## Terminal Wisdom

**Flow trumps features.** A plugin saving five keystrokes while breaking rhythm isn't worth installing.

**Inline beats adjacent.** Whether autocomplete or AI, leaving the prompt for sidebars fractures focus. Warp's genius lies in refusing distraction.

**Context transforms capability.** Agents without memory are glorified macros. Agents with persistent knowledge become collaborators who never forget project history.

**Authentic enthusiasm scales naturally.** If you're writing unpaid tutorials, you're already advocating—formalization just acknowledges reality.

## The Core Truth

I didn't set out to revolutionize my terminal setup or collect another title. I wanted frictionless development. Warp scratched that itch, then evolved until not talking about it felt impossible.

Try it or don't—I'm not here to convert anyone. But if you're still wrestling with tools instead of solving problems, maybe ask yourself why. The best setup is the one that lets you think about code instead of configuration. Everything else follows naturally from there.

_P.S. - Yes, using a proprietary terminal makes me part of the ecosystem. Sometimes the future arrives through unexpected channels._
