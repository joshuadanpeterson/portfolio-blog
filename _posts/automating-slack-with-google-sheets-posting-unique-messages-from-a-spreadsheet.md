# Automating Slack with Google Sheets: Posting Unique Messages from a Spreadsheet

Ever wished you could take a list from Google Sheets—like a column of names—and magically turn it into Slack messages without cluttering your channel with duplicates? I recently tackled this exact challenge, and after some tinkering with Google Apps Script and the Slack API, I’ve got a solution that works like a charm. In this post, I’ll walk you through how to set it up, avoid duplicates, and even pop up a little alert to tell you how many messages made it to Slack. Let’s dive in!

## The Goal

I had a Google Sheet with a list of names in column F, and I wanted each name to kick off a new conversation thread in a Slack channel. But here’s the catch: I didn’t want to spam the channel with repeats if a name was already posted. Plus, I needed to know how many new names actually landed. Sound familiar? Maybe you’re managing team tasks, client lists, or event attendees—this trick can adapt to all sorts of use cases.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Tools

Before we code, we need a few things in place:

- **Google Sheet**: I used a sheet named "Sheet1" in my active spreadsheet. Column F, starting at F2, held my names (e.g., "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"). Empty cells? No problem—they’d be skipped.
- **Slack Token**: I grabbed a user token (`xoxp-...`) from my Slack app, which needed `chat:write` to post messages and `channels:history` to check existing ones. You can create an app at `https://api.slack.com/apps`, add these scopes under "OAuth & Permissions," install it to your workspace, and copy the "OAuth Token for Your Workspace."
- **Channel ID**: For me, it was a specific channel ID (let’s call it `C1234567890`). Find yours by right-clicking a channel in Slack, selecting "Copy Link," and grabbing the ID from the URL (e.g., `https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C1234567890`).

## Step 2: The Script

Google Apps Script is the glue here, connecting Sheets to Slack. Here’s the code I ended up with after some trial and error:

```javascript
// Slack API endpoints and tokens
const SLACK_USER_TOKEN = 'YOUR_SLACK_USER_TOKEN'; // Replace with your user token
const SLACK_CHANNEL = 'C1234567890'; // Replace with your channel ID
const POST_MESSAGE_URL = 'https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage';
const HISTORY_URL = 'https://slack.com/api/conversations.history';

// Fetch recent chat history from Slack channel
function fetchChatHistory() {
  const options = {
    method: 'get',
    contentType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${SLACK_USER_TOKEN}` },
    payload: {
      channel: SLACK_CHANNEL,
      limit: 100
    },
    muteHttpExceptions: true
  };

  const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(HISTORY_URL, options);
  const result = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
  
  if (!result.ok) {
    Logger.log(`Error fetching chat history: ${result.error}`);
    return [];
  }
  
  return result.messages.map(msg =%3E msg.text);
}

// Post a message to Slack
function postMessageToSlack(name) {
  const payload = {
    token: SLACK_USER_TOKEN,
    channel: SLACK_CHANNEL,
    text: name
  };

  const options = {
    method: 'post',
    contentType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    payload: payload,
    muteHttpExceptions: true
  };

  const response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(POST_MESSAGE_URL, options);
  const result = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
  
  if (!result.ok) {
    Logger.log(`Error posting to Slack: ${result.error}`);
    return false;
  } else {
    Logger.log(`Posted name: ${name}`);
    return true;
  }
}

// Main function to create threads from Google Sheets
function createSlackThreadsFromSheet() {
  const spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName('Sheet1');
  if (!sheet) {
    Logger.log('Sheet "Sheet1" not found.');
    return;
  }

  // Get last row with data in column F
  const lastRowInF = sheet.getRange('F:F').getLastRow();
  if (lastRowInF %3C 2) {
    Logger.log('No data in column F starting from F2.');
    return;
  }

  const range = sheet.getRange(`F2:F${lastRowInF}`);
  const values = range.getValues();
  const names = values.flat().filter(String);

  // Fetch existing messages to avoid duplicates
  const existingMessages = fetchChatHistory();
  let addedCount = 0;

  // Post unique names
  names.forEach((name) => {
    if (name) {
      if (existingMessages.includes(name)) {
        Logger.log(`Skipping duplicate name: ${name}`);
      } else {
        const success = postMessageToSlack(name);
        if (success) addedCount++;
        Utilities.sleep(1000); // Avoid rate limits
      }
    }
  });

  // Show pop-up with count
  const ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  ui.alert('Slack Thread Creation Complete', `${addedCount} name${addedCount === 1 ? '' : 's'} were added to the channel.`, ui.ButtonSet.OK);
}

// Add a menu to Google Sheets
function onOpen() {
  SpreadsheetApp.getUi()
    .createMenu('Slack Tools')
    .addItem('Create Threads', 'createSlackThreadsFromSheet')
    .addToUi();
}
```

### How It Works
1. **Grab the Names**: The script targets the "Sheet1" sheet, finds the last non-empty cell in column F (e.g., if "Charlie" is in F5, it stops there), and grabs everything from `F2` down.
2. **Check for Duplicates**: It pulls the last 100 messages from your Slack channel using `conversations.history` and skips any name already posted (case-sensitive, so "Alice" ≠ "alice").
3. **Post New Names**: Each unique name becomes a new message, posted with a 1-second delay to stay under Slack’s rate limit (about 50 messages per minute).
4. **Count and Notify**: Tracks how many names get posted and pops up an alert like "3 names were added to the channel."

### Setting It Up
- **Sheet Prep**: Add your names in "Sheet1," column F, starting at F2. Mine looked like:

  ```
  F2: Alice
  F3: Bob
  F4: Charlie
  ```

- **Script Setup**: In Google Sheets, go to `Extensions > Apps Script`, paste the code, replace `YOUR_SLACK_USER_TOKEN` with your token, and update `C1234567890` with your channel ID.
- **Run It**: Reload the sheet, hit "Slack Tools > Create Threads," and watch the magic happen. Check `View > Logs` for details.

### The Result

After running it, my Slack channel got three new messages: "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie." I ran it again with "Bob" and "Dave" in the sheet—only "Dave" posted, and the pop-up said "1 name was added." No duplicates, just clean, fresh threads ready for replies!

### Tips and Tweaks
- **Case Sensitivity**: Want "Bob" and "bob" to be the same? Change `includes(name)` to `includes(name.toLowerCase())` and compare with `existing.toLowerCase()`.
- **More Messages?**: The script checks the last 100 messages. Bump `limit: 100` to 1000 if your channel’s busy, but it’ll slow things down a bit.
- **Bot vs. User**: I used my user token, so posts showed as me. For a bot vibe (e.g., "MyBot: Alice"), use a bot token instead, add `chat:write` bot scope, and invite the bot to the channel.
- **Rate Limits**: If you’ve got tons of names, tweak `Utilities.sleep(1000)` to avoid hitting Slack’s cap.

### Why It’s Cool

This little script turned my Google Sheet into a Slack command center—no more manual copying or duplicate spam. It’s perfect for syncing lists (names, tasks, whatever) to Slack with zero fuss. Plus, that pop-up at the end? It’s like a high-five for a job well done.

Give it a spin with your own list, and let me know how it goes!
